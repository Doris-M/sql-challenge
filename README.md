### Data Engineering
  - Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
  - Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.


### Data Analysis

### Once you have a complete database, do the following:

    - List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

    - List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

    - List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

    - List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

    - List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

    - List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

    - List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

    - In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


### Bonus

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas.

2. Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
